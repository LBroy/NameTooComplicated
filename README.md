# DrawSquad   [ourApp](http://drawsquad.me)

It is school project showing people the ability of drawing 3D objects on the site with APIs like react-three. We also used Reactjs, Nodejs + Express, Mobx, Mongodb and few other libraries to complete our project. Finally, we used Amazon EC2, NameTooCheap and LetsEncrypt to deploy our website securely.

The whole project approximately takes 80 hours for 3 people to finish from start to end.

# Update [Sept 2018]
since the free tier instance of Amazon EC2 is finsihed, we don't waste our extra bucks on this. So if you are interested, please check our youtube video listed below.
